# CatControl2.0

Its just a playground for me learning java and having a documentation about my progress.

This program is about my cats, i have at least two of them, but i can make a nearly infinite number. 
Its a Database with Gui, a Tableview-Function. 
In the future you can change values at the cats in the database, 
i want to add a small game with stochastic elements and learn with the cats about multithreading-methods.

The main-Method is in catkontrollgruppe/CatControl


Take the Cats.json and place them in the Home-Folder of your User-Account.
